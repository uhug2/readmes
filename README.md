# Manager Readme

My attempt at a [manager readme](https://managerreadme.com/). 

## Who am I?

This is the fluffy part. You can skip to the next part if you want more concrete info.

Some things I like: 
 * reading (Reading [this right now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)
 * [video games](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)
 * running
 * my two kids

Some things I've done: 
* [worked at Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/bea/) as a consultant and [sales engineer](https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/sales-engineer/)
* wrote the first version of [VirtualPlant monitoring and predicive software](https://www.gpstrategies.com/solution/technical-engineering/etapro/etapro-virtualplant-thermal-performance/)
* [ran a marthon](http://www.umsteadmarathon.com/index.php?page=results-2019)

I [wrote some articles about how to evaluate companies when you're interviewing for a job](https://medium.com/@hross). Check them out if you want to know more about how I think.

I also [wrote a blog here that is very sparsely populated](http://blog.hross.net/). It's old, but it will at least give you an idea of the wide variety of technologies and random things I've done.

## What are my principles?

* **Ownership is important.** I have found that the single most important thing you can do in a software shop is to <ins>get things done</ins>. There are two parts to getting things done:

    1. **Driving a feature/issue to completion** without the need for external intervention. Need to go find a product manager? Do it. Something broken somewhere? Fix it.
    1. **Communicating** with other people what's going on while you're getting things done.

* **Caring about your job.** I think people need to genuinely care about their job to do it well. It's the one thing that no manager/leadership can every fully instill upon you. They can give you reasons to care but it's up to you if you actually do or not.

* **Be direct and honest.** I have always felt the urge to "do the right thing". I can't really explain why but I tend toward open communication and being as honest as possible.

* **Live site is important.** There are two reasons I believe in live site support as a first class part of an engineering team:
    1. **Availability is a feature.** How much does buggy software bother you when you use it? It bothers me a lot. I don't want to be responsbile for something that customers dislike.
    1. **Understanding live site is the best way to level up as an engineer.** So many crazy things happen in production that do not happen on your local development box. Want to understand threading/locking/performance? You will need to understand live site under load.

* **Expect from others only what you expect from yourself.** If I can't do it, how can I expect it of people I work with/for? I don't expect anyone to be perfect. I expect a lot of mistakes (I certianly make them). I do expect a level of integrity, showing up where you're needed and a level of caring (see above).

## What do I expect from myself?

* Are we shipping a great product?
* Am I unblocking my direct reports?
* What is falling through the cracks?
* I should be humble enough to assume I can always be better.

## What do I expect from my directs?

* Try to be kind and respectful to others and learn from your mistakes.
* Communicate what's going on with what you're working on.
* Code you ship can be trusted in production.
* You get things done, even if you are blocked or frustrated.
