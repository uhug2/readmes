# Manager Readme

My attempt at a [manager readme](https://managerreadme.com/). 

## Who am I?

Some things I like: 
 * reading (reading [this right now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive))
 * [video games](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena)
 * running
 * my two kids

Some things I've done: 
* wrote the first version of [VirtualPlant monitoring and predictive software](https://www.gpstrategies.com/solution/technical-engineering/etapro/etapro-virtualplant-thermal-performance/)
* [ran a marathon](http://www.umsteadmarathon.com/index.php?page=results-2019)
* [worked on the pull request experience at Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser)
* [worked at Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/bea/) as a consultant and [sales engineer](https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/sales-engineer/)

I [wrote some articles about how to evaluate companies when you're interviewing for a job](https://medium.com/@hross). Check them out if you want to know more about how I think.

I also [wrote a blog here that is very sparsely populated](http://blog.hross.net/). It's old, but it will at least give you an idea of the wide variety of technologies and random things I've done.

## What are my principles?

* **Expect from others only what you expect from yourself.** If I can't do it, how can I expect it of people I work with/for? I don't expect anyone to be perfect. I expect a lot of mistakes (I certainly make them). I do expect a level of integrity, showing up where you're needed and a level of caring (see above).

* **Honesty and Directness.** I have always felt the urge to "do the right thing". I can't really explain why but I tend toward open communication and being as honest as possible.

* **Ownership is important.** I have found that the single most important thing you can do in software is to <ins>get things done</ins>. There are two parts to getting things done:

    1. **Driving something to completion** without the need for external intervention. Even if it's not necessarily your job, it's worth doing it to get the thing you need done.
    1. **Communicating** with other people what's going on while you're getting things done.

* **Caring about your job.** I think people need to genuinely care about their job to do it well. For myself, if I stop caring about my job I need to find that motivation or find something else to do.

* **Live site is important.** There are two reasons I believe in live site support as a first class part of an engineering team:
    1. **Availability is a feature.** How much does buggy software bother you when you use it? It bothers me a lot. I don't want to be responsbile for something that customers dislike.
    1. **Understanding live site is the best way to level up as an engineer.** So many crazy things happen in production that do not happen on your local development box. Want to understand threading/locking/performance? You will need to understand live site under load.

## What do I expect from myself?

* Are we shipping a great product?
* Am I unblocking my direct reports?
* What is falling through the cracks?
* I should be humble enough to assume I can always be better. Not hard because I have [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). All the time. In everything I do. 

## What do I expect from my directs?

* Try to be kind and respectful to others and learn from your mistakes.
* Communicate what's going on with what you're working on.
* Code you ship can be trusted in production.
* You get things done, even if you are blocked or frustrated.
